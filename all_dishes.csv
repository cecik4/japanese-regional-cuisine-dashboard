Passed down since the Edo period, it is regarded as a symbol of good luck. The konoshiro fish, a small brackish-water herring about 5 cm long, is highly prized—the smaller the fish, the higher the price. Although often associated with winter, the Kuma River estuary allows year-round catches in the Yatsushiro Sea. Because the fish spoils quickly, it is best served with vinegar, which preserves flavor and freshness. Preparation involves gutting the fish, salting, and soaking in sweet vinegar, then filling it with rice (seasoned with green onion, ginger, sesame) and shaping into sushi; the head and tail are placed upright on the plate.
