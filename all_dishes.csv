Ikinari dango,Kumamoto,Kikuchi area,"sweet potatoes, wheat flour, sweet bean paste","Ikinari dango is a regional Kumamoto snack made by wrapping sliced sweet potatoes in a simple wheat-and-dango dough and steaming. It originated with farmers in the Kikuchi and Kumamoto Plains during the fall harvest, as sweet potatoes from volcanic ash soils around Mt. Aso and Otsu were plentiful. The name ikinari, from the Kumamoto dialect, means “easy, quick, or immediately,” reflecting that the dumplings can be prepared fast and served to sudden visitors. The dough uses wheat flour and dango flour with salt; in the past rice was scarce, so it was often made with wheat flour only. A filling of azuki bean paste was added a few decades ago and gained popularity for the sweet-salty contrast. Modern variations include mugwort, brown sugar dough, soybean flour coatings, and fillings such as purple sweet potato, chestnuts, and walnuts.

During the Edo period meat bans, it was served as a nutritious medicinal food. Before WWII, locals ate it; Mt. Aso pastureland produced army horses, and postwar shortages made horsemeat a substitute for beef and pork. By around 1955, local restaurants popularized horsemeat dishes.
